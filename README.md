First three_js project 
First time using a local server to run code, using Vite

To run:

  At first use:
    npm create vite@latest
      make project(?) name (first_vite in this case)
    I selected vanilla, then JavaScript
    npm i three gsap
    
  Second and later:
    cd first_vite (project name)
    npm run dev

  and boom
